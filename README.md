# Welcome to my website at `github.io`.

This website is used temporarely as a repository for my reunion slides.
It has been created using [Marp](https://marpit.marp.app/) as a tool to generate the frontpage.

## About my website

As the need to share some slides with other participants of my study groups grew stronger I decided to endure the effort to learn how to use Github first and then Github.io as a repository of shared projects and a website gently offed for free.

The main website subject is Spiritist Doctrine as codified by Allan Kardec. Fell free and very welcome to take a look inside, althogh it is, for the time beeing, all writen in Portuguese!

As you might suspect the site URL is: [https://cunhapaulo.github.io/](https://cunhapaulo.github.io/).

Cheers!
