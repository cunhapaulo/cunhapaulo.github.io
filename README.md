# Welcome to my website at `github.io`

This website has been conceived to be used temporarely as a repository for the slides used in my study groups. It is under continuous creation using [Marp](https://marpit.marp.app/) to build up the website using the metaphor of slide decks.

## About my website

As the need to share these slides with other group members grew stronger, I decided to endure the effort to learn how to use Github, as a first chalenge and then Github.io as a repository of shared projects and a stylish free of charge website.

The main concern of this website is the Spiritist Doctrine as codified by Allan Kardec. Fell free and welcome to take a look inside, although it is, for the time beeing, all writen in Portuguese!

As you might suspect, the site URL is: [https://cunhapaulo.github.io/](https://cunhapaulo.github.io/).

Cheers!
